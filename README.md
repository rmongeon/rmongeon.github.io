# Portfolio Project
### By Becca Mongeon

This project was required to have specific qualities. Some of the key qualities were
* Show a basic understanding of HTML5 & CSS
  * no style elements in HTML
* The page must be responsive on all display sizes. 
  * PC, Tablet, Mobile
* HTML and CSS must be validated and follow design standards

Stock images were used to fill the sections for projects, since I haven't had other projects to show off. I originally wrote this project in codepen.io, and ported it over to github.
